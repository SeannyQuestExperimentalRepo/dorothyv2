## 4. Cold Call Scripts

### Universal 30-Second Opener

> "Hi [NAME], this is Seanny with Itential — I know I'm catching you out of the blue. I'll be quick.
>
> We help companies like [SIMILAR COMPANY IN THEIR INDUSTRY] orchestrate network changes across all their automation tools — Ansible, Terraform, NSO, whatever they're running — from a single platform.
>
> The reason I'm calling is [SPECIFIC TRIGGER/REASON].
>
> Does that resonate at all, or am I way off base?"

**Key principles:**
- Acknowledge the cold call (disarms)
- Name-drop a peer company
- Give them an easy out (paradoxically keeps them on)

### Industry-Specific Value Props

#### Telecom Variation
> "We work with service providers who are managing thousands of network changes per week across multi-vendor environments — Cisco, Juniper, Nokia, you name it. Our platform sits above all those tools and orchestrates changes with built-in validation, so your team spends less time on CLI and more time on architecture.
>
> I noticed [Telus/Rogers/etc.] is [expanding fiber/rolling out 5G/integrating acquisitions] — that usually means the network change volume is through the roof. How is your team handling that today?"

#### Financial Services Variation
> "We work with financial institutions that need every network change to be auditable, compliant, and zero-downtime. Our platform creates an automated audit trail for every change and ensures consistent execution whether it's a branch firewall rule or a core router update.
>
> With [SOX/PCI/DORA] requirements tightening, how confident is your team that every network change is documented and compliant today?"

#### Energy/Utility Variation
> "We work with utilities that need to maintain NERC CIP compliance while modernizing their network infrastructure. Our platform automates the entire change lifecycle — from approval through execution through documentation — so your compliance team isn't chasing engineers for change records.
>
> How are you handling the documentation and compliance requirements for network changes on critical infrastructure today?"

#### General Enterprise Variation
> "We work with large enterprises running multi-vendor networks where the automation team has Ansible playbooks, Terraform configs, maybe some Python scripts — but no single place to orchestrate it all. Our platform unifies all of that into automated workflows that anyone on the team can execute.
>
> Is your network team currently stitching together multiple automation tools, or have you solved that orchestration challenge?"

### After They Engage (Discovery Pivot)

> "That's really helpful context. A few quick questions so I can see if it even makes sense to continue the conversation:
>
> 1. How many network devices are you managing today?
> 2. What tools are you using for automation — Ansible, Terraform, homegrown scripts?
> 3. Who on your team owns the network automation strategy?
>
> Based on what you're telling me, it sounds like it'd be worth getting 30 minutes with [you / your team lead] and one of our solutions engineers to show how this maps to your environment. Would [DAY] or [DAY] work better?"

### Gatekeeper Navigation

> **Gatekeeper:** "What is this regarding?"
>
> "I'm following up on some research I've been doing on [COMPANY]'s network infrastructure — trying to connect with whoever owns network automation strategy. Would that be [NAME] or someone else on the team?"

> **Gatekeeper:** "Can you send an email?"
>
> "Absolutely, I'll send something over. What's the best email for [NAME]? I want to make sure it's specific to what they care about."

## 5. Email Sequences

### Sequence 1: Telecom-Focused (14 days, 5 touches)

#### Email 1 — Day 1: "The Orchestration Gap"
**Subject:** [COMPANY] network changes — orchestrated or duct-taped?

> Hi [FIRST NAME],
>
> Running a service provider network means thousands of changes per week across Cisco, Juniper, Nokia, and everything in between. Most teams I talk to have automated pieces of it — an Ansible playbook here, a Python script there — but nothing orchestrating the full lifecycle.
>
> That's the gap Itential fills. We sit above your existing tools and orchestrate end-to-end network changes with built-in validation and rollback. One service provider cut their change-related incidents by 85% in the first quarter.
>
> Worth a 20-minute look to see if [COMPANY] has the same gap?
>
> — Seanny

#### Email 2 — Day 3: "The Peer Play"
**Subject:** How [PEER TELCO] handles multi-vendor automation

> [FIRST NAME] — quick follow-up.
>
> The challenge I keep hearing from network engineering leaders at service providers:
>
> *"We have 6 automation tools and none of them talk to each other."*
>
> Itential's FlowAI uses agentic orchestration to unify those tools into a single workflow. Think of it as the orchestration brain that decides which tool runs which step, validates the output, and documents every change automatically.
>
> If that sounds like a problem you're solving (or struggling with), I'd love 20 minutes.
>
> — Seanny

#### Email 3 — Day 7: "The Trigger Event"
**Subject:** [COMPANY]-specific: [5G rollout / fiber expansion / acquisition integration]

> [FIRST NAME],
>
> I noticed [COMPANY] is [SPECIFIC TRIGGER — e.g., "expanding fiber to 2M new homes" / "integrating Suddenlink's network" / "rolling out standalone 5G"].
>
> That kind of initiative usually 3-5x's the volume of network changes. The teams that handle it well have an orchestration layer that automates the repetitive changes so engineers focus on the complex ones.
>
> That's exactly what Itential does. Would it make sense to show you how in 20 minutes?
>
> — Seanny

#### Email 4 — Day 10: "The Value Bomb"
**Subject:** 85% fewer network incidents

> [FIRST NAME],
>
> One number: **85% reduction in change-related network incidents.**
>
> That's what happens when you stop letting humans fat-finger CLI commands and start orchestrating changes through validated, automated workflows.
>
> Itential doesn't replace your existing tools — it makes Ansible, Terraform, NSO, and your homegrown scripts work together as one system.
>
> Last attempt to connect before I assume the timing's off. Worth a quick chat?
>
> — Seanny

#### Email 5 — Day 14: "The Breakup"
**Subject:** closing the loop

> [FIRST NAME],
>
> I've reached out a few times about network automation orchestration at [COMPANY]. I don't want to be that person who won't take a hint.
>
> If it's not relevant → no hard feelings, just reply "pass" and I'll close this out.
>
> If the timing is just off → let me know when to circle back.
>
> If you're curious but busy → here's a 2-minute overview: [ITENTIAL RESOURCE LINK]
>
> Either way, I'll stop here. Appreciate your time.
>
> — Seanny

---

### Sequence 2: Financial Services (14 days, 5 touches)

#### Email 1 — Day 1: "Compliance Meets Automation"
**Subject:** every network change at [COMPANY] — documented and compliant?

> Hi [FIRST NAME],
>
> In financial services, every network change needs an audit trail. But most network teams are still making changes manually or through disconnected automation scripts — which means compliance documentation is an afterthought.
>
> Itential automates the entire network change lifecycle — including the documentation. Every change is orchestrated through a validated workflow, and every step is logged automatically. No more chasing engineers for change records before an audit.
>
> Does [COMPANY] have this solved, or is it still a manual pain point?
>
> — Seanny

#### Email 2 — Day 4: "The Risk Frame"
**Subject:** re: network change risk at [COMPANY]

> [FIRST NAME],
>
> Quick stat: **72% of network outages are caused by human error during changes** (Gartner).
>
> For a financial institution processing [transactions/claims/trades], a network outage isn't just downtime — it's regulatory exposure, customer impact, and front-page risk.
>
> Itential orchestrates network changes with pre-change validation, automated rollback, and complete audit trails. It's how enterprises eliminate the "fat finger" risk without slowing down their teams.
>
> Worth 20 minutes to see how it maps to [COMPANY]?
>
> — Seanny

#### Email 3 — Day 7: "The Regulatory Urgency"
**Subject:** [SOX / PCI-DSS / DORA] and network change management

> [FIRST NAME],
>
> With [SOX/PCI/DORA] requirements, regulators are looking more closely at operational resilience — and that includes how network changes are managed.
>
> The question auditors are starting to ask: *"Can you prove that every network change followed an approved process?"*
>
> Itential makes the answer "yes" by default — every change runs through an orchestrated workflow with built-in approvals, validation, and documentation.
>
> If this is on your radar, I'd love to show you how it works in 20 minutes.
>
> — Seanny

#### Email 4 — Day 10: "The Branch Problem"
**Subject:** automating network changes across [X,000] locations

> [FIRST NAME],
>
> Managing network changes across [NUMBER] branch locations is a different beast than managing a data center. Different hardware, different configs, different constraints — but the same need for consistency.
>
> Itential gives you a single orchestration platform that pushes validated changes to any device, any vendor, any location. One workflow, thousands of endpoints, zero inconsistency.
>
> 20 minutes to see if it fits [COMPANY]'s environment?
>
> — Seanny

#### Email 5 — Day 14: "The Breakup"
**Subject:** closing the loop on network automation

> [FIRST NAME] — I've reached out a few times about how Itential helps financial institutions automate network changes with built-in compliance.
>
> Not trying to be a pest. Three options:
>
> 1. **Interested** → reply and we'll find 20 minutes
> 2. **Wrong person** → point me to whoever owns network automation
> 3. **Not relevant** → reply "pass" and I'll disappear
>
> Appreciate your time either way.
>
> — Seanny

---

### Sequence 3: General Enterprise (14 days, 4 touches)

#### Email 1 — Day 1: "The Tool Sprawl Problem"
**Subject:** [COMPANY]'s network automation — unified or fragmented?

> Hi [FIRST NAME],
>
> Most enterprise network teams I talk to have the same problem: Ansible for some things, Terraform for others, Python scripts for the weird stuff, and a prayer holding it all together.
>
> Itential is the orchestration layer that sits above all of it. One platform that coordinates Ansible, Terraform, NSO, APIs — whatever you're running — into end-to-end automated workflows. No rip-and-replace, no starting over.
>
> Is tool sprawl a pain point for your network team, or have you already cracked that nut?
>
> — Seanny

#### Email 2 — Day 4: "The Agility Angle"
**Subject:** 10x network agility at [COMPANY]

> [FIRST NAME],
>
> Quick question: how long does a standard network change take at [COMPANY] from request to completion?
>
> For most enterprises, it's days to weeks. With Itential, teams are executing validated network changes in minutes — and doing 10x more of them without adding headcount.
>
> If your business is moving faster than your network team can keep up, that's exactly the problem we solve.
>
> — Seanny

#### Email 3 — Day 8: "The AI/Agentic Frame"
**Subject:** agentic network automation (not just another AI pitch)

> [FIRST NAME],
>
> Everyone's talking about AI. Here's what it actually looks like for network engineering:
>
> Itential's FlowAI uses agentic orchestration — meaning the platform can autonomously execute multi-step network workflows, validate each step, and make intelligent decisions about what to do next. Not a chatbot. An actual automation agent that does the work.
>
> If you're exploring how AI applies to network operations (without the hype), this is worth 20 minutes.
>
> — Seanny

#### Email 4 — Day 14: "The Breakup"
**Subject:** last note from me

> [FIRST NAME] — I'll keep this short.
>
> I've been reaching out about Itential's network automation orchestration. If the timing's wrong or it's not relevant, no worries at all.
>
> If it ever becomes relevant, I'm easy to find. Here's a quick resource in the meantime: [LINK]
>
> — Seanny

### Stage 0 Criteria (Initial Meeting Booked)

A meeting qualifies as Stage 0 when **ALL** of the following are true:

| Criteria | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Right Person** | Dir+ level in Network Engineering, Infrastructure, or IT Operations |
| **Right Company** | Fits ICP: Fortune 2000, telco, financial services, utilities, or enterprise with 1,000+ network devices |
| **Right Meeting** | 30-min discovery call scheduled with prospect + Itential SE |
| **Confirmed** | Meeting is accepted on calendar (not just proposed) |

### Stage 1 Criteria (Qualified Opportunity)

A Stage 0 converts to Stage 1 when discovery confirms:

| MEDDIC Element | Stage 1 Qualification |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Metrics** | Prospect can articulate a measurable problem (change volume, incident rate, time-to-change, compliance gaps) |
| **Economic Buyer** | Identified — VP+ who controls budget. May not be in the room yet, but named |
| **Decision Criteria** | Understood what "success" looks like (vendor-agnostic, integrates with existing tools, compliance, etc.) |
| **Decision Process** | Know the eval process — POC? RFP? Executive briefing? Timeline? |
| **Identify Pain** | Confirmed 1+ of: tool sprawl, manual changes causing incidents, compliance risk, can't scale automation, slow change velocity |
| **Champion** | The person in the discovery call is willing to advocate internally and schedule a next step |

### Quick Qualification Questions (Discovery Call)

1. "How many network changes does your team execute per week/month?"
2. "What happens when a change goes wrong? What's the rollback process?"
3. "What automation tools are you using today? How do they work together?"
4. "Who owns the network automation strategy? Is there a dedicated team?"
5. "Have you evaluated orchestration platforms before? What happened?"
6. "If you could automate one network workflow tomorrow, what would it be?"
7. "What's driving the urgency — is there a compliance deadline, a business initiative, or an incident that triggered this?"
8. "What would need to be true for you to bring this to your VP?"

### Disqualification Signals (Save Your Time)

- Fewer than 200 network devices (too small)
- No automation tools at all (not ready for orchestration)
- Actively in contract with a competitor (revisit in 12 months)
- No network engineering team (IT generalists only)
- "We built our own" and they're happy with it (revisit in 6 months)

## 9. Objection Handling Matrix

### Objection 1: "We already use Ansible"

> **Response:** "That's actually perfect — most of our customers do. Itential doesn't replace Ansible; it sits above it. Think of it this way: Ansible is great at executing tasks on devices. Itential orchestrates the full workflow — decides which Ansible playbook to run, validates the output, handles rollback if something fails, and documents everything. It's the difference between having a tool and having a system.
>
> Out of curiosity, how many Ansible playbooks are you managing today? And who maintains them?"

### Objection 2: "We're happy with Cisco NSO"

> **Response:** "Good — NSO is a strong tool for Cisco environments. Where Itential comes in is when you need to orchestrate beyond Cisco. If you have Juniper, Palo Alto, cloud infrastructure, or any non-Cisco gear, NSO handles that piece and Itential orchestrates the full end-to-end workflow across all of them.
>
> Is your environment 100% Cisco, or do you have multi-vendor?"

### Objection 3: "We don't have budget for this"

> **Response:** "Totally fair. Let me ask it differently — what's the cost of a network outage caused by a manual change error? For most enterprises, it's $5-10K+ per incident. If your team has even one per month, the math on Itential pays for itself.
>
> Would it be useful to quantify that for your environment? Sometimes that's the conversation that unlocks budget."

### Objection 4: "Not a priority right now"

> **Response:** "I hear you — there's always more priorities than bandwidth. What IS the top priority for your network team this quarter?
>
> [Listen, then connect Itential to whatever they say. Network refresh → need orchestration. Cloud migration → need multi-tool coordination. Compliance audit → need automated documentation.]
>
> Even if it's not a priority today, would it be useful to see a 20-minute demo so you know what's possible when the timing is right?"

### Objection 5: "We're building it ourselves"

> **Response:** "A lot of teams start there — it makes sense when you're automating a few workflows. The challenge usually hits around workflow 50 or 100 — maintaining all those scripts, handling edge cases, onboarding new team members who didn't write the code.
>
> Where are you in that journey? 10 workflows? 100? And how many people maintain them?"

### Objection 6: "I need to talk to my boss"

> **Response:** "Of course. Would it help if I put together a one-page summary of what we discussed? That way you have something concrete to share.
>
> Better yet — would it make sense to just include your boss in a 20-minute follow-up? I can tailor it to what they care about."

### Objection 7: "Send me some information"

> **Response:** "Happy to. So I send you something relevant and not generic — what's the biggest challenge your network team is facing right now? That way I can point you to the right resources.
>
> [If they give you something specific, send a targeted follow-up. If they're brushing you off, send the resource and follow up in 3 days.]"

### Objection 8: "We just went through a vendor evaluation"

> **Response:** "Got it — who'd you end up going with, if you don't mind me asking?
>
> [If competitor] — Good choice for [X]. Where Itential differs is [specific differentiator]. If you ever hit a wall with [competitor limitation], keep me in mind.
>
> [If they chose nothing] — What held the decision up? Sometimes we can help frame it differently."

### Objection 9: "Our network is too legacy / not ready"

> **Response:** "That's actually where Itential shines. We're not asking you to rip out your legacy infrastructure. Itential connects to anything with an API, CLI, or SNMP — including legacy gear. It's designed to bridge the gap between old and new.
>
> What does your network environment look like today? Mix of legacy and modern?"

### Objection 10: "I don't have time for a demo"

> **Response:** "Totally respect that. What if instead of a demo, I send you a 3-minute video that shows exactly how it works for [THEIR INDUSTRY]? If it looks interesting, we can find time. If not, I won't bug you.
>
> What's the best email?"

## Quick Reference Card (Print This)

### The 30-Second Itential Pitch
*"Itential is the orchestration layer that sits above your existing automation tools — Ansible, Terraform, NSO, whatever you're running. Instead of managing 10 different tools that don't talk to each other, you get one platform that coordinates all of them into automated, validated workflows. Customers see 85% fewer change-related incidents and 10x the network agility."*

### When They Ask "How Is This Different From..."

| Competitor | Itential Differentiator |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Ansible/Red Hat | Ansible executes tasks. Itential orchestrates workflows across Ansible + everything else. We make Ansible better, not replace it. |
| Cisco NSO | NSO is strong for Cisco. Itential orchestrates across ALL vendors including Cisco. True vendor-agnostic. |
| Terraform | Terraform is for provisioning infrastructure. Itential orchestrates Day 2+ network operations across any tool. |
| ServiceNow | ServiceNow is ITSM/ticketing. Itential is the automation engine that ServiceNow triggers. We integrate, not compete. |
| Homegrown scripts | Scripts work for 10 workflows. At 100+, you need a platform. Itential scales where scripts break. |

### FlowAI / Agentic Talking Points
- **What it is:** AI-powered orchestration that can autonomously build and execute network workflows
- **Not a chatbot:** It actually does the work — validates, executes, rolls back
- **MCP Server:** Connects Itential to any AI/LLM tool via Model Context Protocol
- **When to bring it up:** When prospect mentions AI strategy, when they're forward-thinking, when talking to architects vs. ops managers
